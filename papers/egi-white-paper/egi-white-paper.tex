\section{Aim of this document}

 The aim of this document is to inform designers, architects and users
 of production level distributed Computing infrastructures of the role
 the SAGA API can play as an end user access layer.

\section{Introduction}

 The "Simple API for Grid Applications"  is, as the name suggests, a
 simple API which allows to implement distributed applications.  It
 originally focused on Grid applications (i.e. applications running
 in Grid environments), but in fact maps well to all kinds of
 distributed infrastructures.

 SAGA was designed with 3 main goals:

 \begin{enumerate}

  \item provide a stable programming interface to application
  programmers
 
  \item allow to simply express distributed application properties,
  by providing high level abstraction of distributed and remote
  operations
  
  \item shield the application developer from heterogeneous and
  evolving infrastructures and middlewares

 \end{enumerate}

 The fact that SAGA is an OGF standard ensures the stability of the
 API.   SAGA's scope is defined top-down, i.e. is determined by the
 high-level (i,e, application level) requirements.  And SAGA's main
 design principle is the 80:20 rule: 80\% of functionality at 20\% of
 the complexity.


\section{The SAGA Landscape}

 \subsection{SAGA API Specification}

  The SAGA API specification process is hosted by the Open Grid Forum
  (http://www.ogf.org/).  The SAGA Working group within OGFs
  application area first collected a set of ca. 20 use cases,
  considered representative for a wide range of distributed scientific
  applications.  Based on these use cases, the group defined a set if
  high level abstractions commonly required by those use cases.  Those
  abstractions were then mapped into different SAGA API packages,
  while ensuring that (a) the overall usability (e.g. the API
  look-and-feel) was consistent over the whole scope of the API, (b)
  the API functionality maps relatively well (but not necessarily
  simply) onto existing middleware features, and (c) the API stayed
  simple to use.

  The fact that the resulting SAGA API specification is a rather hefty
  document is not a token of the complexity of the resulting API, but
  rather a token for the level of detail the API semantics is
  specified.  Also, it must be noted while the resulting API is indeed
  rather simple to use, it is, to most parts, rather difficult to {\bf
  implement} - ease of implementation has {\it not} been a design goal
  for SAGA.  Modern distributed computing environments are very
  complex infrastructures, and allowing applications to make use of
  these complex systems is not trivial.  By defining a simple API, one
  requires those complexities to be dealt with on a different layer,
  i.e. within the SAGA API implementation. This is on purpose, as it
  allows to keep those complexities out of the application code, which
  is a declared goal of SAGA.

  The SAGA API specification is object oriented, and language
  independent (the API is defined in IDL).  The API is structured into
  various packages (e.g. jobs, replicas, streams, etc.).  Those
  packages have limited dependencies amongst each other - not all SAGA
  implementations implement all packages.  All API packages share
  certain properties: how are synchronous methods expressed, how are
  notifications realized, how are security tokens expressed, what
  types of exceptions are defined, etc.  Those properties are
  specified in the SAGA-Core, the API's look and feel.  

  That design of the SAGA API allows to specify additional API
  packages, which adhere to the same look-and-feel.  In fact, several
  such API packages have already been defined, and are standardized as
  well, or are in the process of being standardized.


 \subsection{SAGA Development Efforts}

  The language independent SAGA API specification has been mapped to
  multiple programming languages, in particular to C++, Java and
  Python.  Multiple implementations exists, the  most notable ones are
  SAGA-C++, JSAGA and JavaSAGA.

  SAGA-C++ is...

  JSAGA and JavaSAGA are …

  All three implementations provide python bindings - the Java
  implementations realize those via Jython, the C++-implementation via
  boost-python.  The two python bindings are at the moment being
  unified, and have already been shown to be interoperable.

  Interestingly, all three discussed SAGA implementations are adaptor
  based: they implement a relatively small library which provides the
  SAGA API, and a set of adaptors which translate the SAGA API calls
  into the respective middleware operations.  It is those adaptors
  which encapsulate most of the complexity which was formerly present
  in the applications layer.  While SAGA adaptors are relatively easy
  to implement, at least as a prototype, they require significant
  maintainance effort to keep up with the middleare intricacies and
  evolution.


 \subsection{Important SAGA Deployments}

  The different SAGA implementations, and in particular SAGA-C++, have
  by now been in use in different user communities for a number of
  years, and thus have matured enough to enter the  field of
  production cyber infrastructures.  At the same time, the number of
  supported backends has grown to a level that basically all current
  production infrastructures are supported (e.g. for jobs we support
  ARC, gLite, Globus, Condor, PBS, Torque, DRMAA, EC2, Eucalyptus,
  BES,  Naregi, Unicore, SMOA, Genesis-II, fork, and ssh).  

  SAGA has so far been successfully and routinely used on the
  TeraGrid, Loni, FutureGrid, DEISA, DGrid, and a number of smaller,
  more localized cyber infrastructures.  While SAGA is relatively easy
  to deploy in applications space (i.e. user space), its overall goal
  of improving the end user experience of distributed systems benefits
  greatly from system level installations.



\section{SAGA Usage Modes and Active Projects}

\subsection{SAGA usage modes}

  Although SAGA is foremost an API, the SAGA distributions support end
  users in a variety of ways.  In particular, the SAGA distributions
  also include command line tools implemented via the SAGA API, and
  higher level libraries for common distributed programming patterns,
  also basing on the SAGA API. 

  SAGAs main objective is to support and simplify the implementation
  of distributed applications.  As described above, that is achieved
  by providing a library which implements the SAGA API.  However,
  distributed applications have to *wrestle* with distributed
  infrastructures at more layers than just APIs, and the SAGA
  distributions tries to address a number of additional issues as
  well. In particular prototyping, deployment, and application
  enrolement and bootstrapping are continous concerns for end users.

  \subsubsection*{Application Prototyping}

   The SAGA python bindings have been proven to be immensely helpful
   for application prototyping.  But also, they are very helpful when
   interactively testing remote operations (in the interactive python
   interpreter / python shell).  Finally, it is very easy to implement
   small command line tools in python, which are able to mimic and
   test smaller portions of the overall application.  For example, it
   is straight forward to implement a specific job control component
   of an application in a stand alone python script, and to later
   include the same functionality in the application proper, with the
   confidence that the semantics of the remote operations will be well
   preserved (remember: the SAGA specification is very strict about
   the definition of semantics).
